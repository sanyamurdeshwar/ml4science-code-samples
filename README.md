My prior research code related to molecular dynamics currently lives in private repositories at the moment, so I created a small non-proprietary public code sample that re-implements some of the core ideas I worked on (geometry-aware generative modeling on toy distributions and a fractal dataset generator used for testing generative models).
On another note, the code has been made available for my recently-published paper ("A Standardized Benchmark for Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics Using Weighted Ensemble Sampling") in the JPC B found here: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcb.5c05365
